		<h2>A letter from out President...</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome, and thanks for visiting our humble website.<br><br>
			We are a small engineering and design firm located in Winnipeg, Canada. We've been in business since 2008 but have experience in new product design going back as far as 1996.<br><br>
			Our experience is in additive manufacturing (3d printing), plastics, diesel powertrains, hybrid (gas & diesel-electric) powertrains, suspension, structures, chassis, buses, tractors, swathers, cars and motorcycles. We have also worked on several large industrial equipment projects. There's too much to list here so please contact us to see if we can help out on your next project.<br><br>
			As a side note, if you came here looking for images of boardrooms filled with well-dressed people pointing at blueprints, we might not be the designers for you. We believe in the adage, "never trust a well-dressed engineer", and we'll typically have a bit of grime under our fingernails!<br><br>
			Thanks for your interest,<br>
			Blaine McFarlane, P.Eng., President.
